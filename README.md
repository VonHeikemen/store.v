# store

A simple key-value pair database for your shell functions.

And by "database" I mean a plain json file in a directory somewhere in your system. This is basically a helper that does some CRUD operations to a json file.

## Getting started

### Installation

* Easiest:

Go to the [release page](https://github.com/VonHeikemen/store.v/releases) and download the zip file that corresponds to your operating system. Then put the executable somewhere in your PATH.

* From source:

You'll need to install [v-lang](https://vlang.io/)'s compiler (at least version `0.2.2 commit: 90292ce`). After that follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VonHeikemen/store.v.git
cd store.v
v -prod store.v
```

You'll end up with a `store` executable in the root directory. Add that to your PATH.

## Usage

```sh
store [document] [command] [args]
```

### Commands

### Environment

All this examples use a document called `bookmark` but this of course could be anything you want.
